\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conclude}
    This paper presents an automated systematic approach to compress a convolutional neural networks using Reinforcement learning.
    The key idea behind this method is to incorporate real-world latency information into reward function to find faster performing compressed models without much tradeoff in accuracy. We demonstrated that subset based model compression can be helpful in scenarios where the deployed model sees only a subset of data classes. We proposed policy transfer as way to solve large scale deployment of our compression algorithm.
